            <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
            <p class="p-2">A food ordering website with a friendly user interface where users can explore and order from
                local
                restaurants. Users can create accounts, browse meals, order online with multiple payment options, and
                track orders. The website will provide restaurant owners with an admin portal to manage their menus,
                pricing, and deliveries. This website can boost the growth of local restaurants while
                allowing consumers to try out new cuisines.
                <br><br>

                To improve the user experience, features like a filtering system that lets users view dishes based on
                their preferences, dietary restrictions, and allergies would be added. A review system would also allow
                users to give their opinions to other future users while providing valuable feedback to the restaurant.
                In terms of development, the website’s frontend will be made using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and
                JavaScript. For the backend web server running on my VM, I will use Node.js to run an express server to
                handle client API requests and database interactions (MongoDB or Supabase, as they are efficient and
                ensure data integrity). My website will incorporate Stripe as a payment processing solution to handle
                payments securely. I have chosen the above frameworks since I’m somewhat familiar with them.
                <br><br>
                By the end of this project, I aim to achieve a fully functioning food-ordering website running on my
                virtual machine in the cloud.

            <h2>License</h2>
            <p>I have decided to use the MIT license because it’s very permissive, and its simplicity doesn’t require a
                legal expert to understand it. It grants users the freedom to use, copy, modify, and publish their
                copies of the software. Using the MIT license, I can make my code accessible and encourage other
                developers to collaborate and improve my work. In conclusion, the MIT license is an ideal choice to
                promote collaboration, accessibility, and growth of my project within the community.
